# Masked_letter_prediction
  Predicting a masked letter, I used the Spello Language Correction model. Spello is a spellcorrection model built with combination of two models, Phoneme and Symspell Phoneme Model uses Soundex algo in background and suggests correct spellings using phonetic concepts to identify similar sounding words. On the other hand, Symspell Model uses concept of edit-distance in order to suggest correct spellings.
